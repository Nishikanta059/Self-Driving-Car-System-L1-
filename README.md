# Self-Driving-Car-System-L1-
The objective of this  project is to build an end-to-end self-driving (level-1) system. We  implement the Deep Q-Learning algorithm to control a simulated car,  end-to-end, autonomously. The algorithm is based on reinforcement  learning which teaches machines what to do through interactions with  the environment.
