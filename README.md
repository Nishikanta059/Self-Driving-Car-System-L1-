## Introduction üìÑ  

The **Self-Driving Car System** is a Level-1 autonomous driving solution using **Deep Reinforcement Learning** techniques combined with **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. The project focuses on:  
1. **End-to-End Driving**: Using a front-facing camera to generate steering commands.  
2. **Traffic Light Detection**: Recognizing and classifying traffic lights with a CNN-based classifier.  
3. **Object Detection**: Detecting pedestrians and vehicles using the **YOLOv5** model.  

The system was tested on open-source simulators and achieved high autonomy while navigating complex curves and detecting obstacles.
